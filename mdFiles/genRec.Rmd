# General advice

-   Consider what measures you can take to reduce the risks posed by your data, for example, via [de-identification](https://fgb-rdm.nl/Security/Deidentification.html){target="_blank"}; if you can reduce the risks, you will have more freedom of choice when it comes to security, tools available, data sharing and so forth.
-   Consider how you segregate your various data to reduce the overall risks, for example, if all of your data together result in a red data risk, consider separating the higher risk data from the lower risk data
