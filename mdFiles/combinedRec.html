# General advice

-   Consider what measures you can take to reduce the risks posed by your data, for example, via [de-identification](https://fgb-rdm.nl/Security/Deidentification.html){target="_blank"}; if you can reduce the risks, you will have more freedom of choice when it comes to security, tools available, data sharing and so forth.
-   Consider how you segregate your various data to reduce the overall risks, for example, if all of your data together result in a red data risk, consider separating the higher risk data from the lower risk data

# Storage of yellow data

*Detailed information on storage can be found on the [secure storage page](https://fgb-rdm.nl/Security/Storage.html){target="_blank"}.*

-   Yellow data may be stored in [YODA](https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/yoda.html){target="_blank"}, [Research Drive](https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/researchdrive.html){target="_blank"}, [SciStor](https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/scistor.html){target="_blank"} and, in some instances, Teams/Sharepoint
    -   Use [this table](https://fgb-rdm.nl/Security/Storage.html#FGBrecs){target="_blank"} to decide which option will work best for you
    -   If Teams seems to be the best option for you, contact the [faculty data stewards](mailto:research.data.fgb@vu.nl) for further advice before using it for yellow data
-   Ensure that you follow the [security guidance](https://fgb-rdm.nl/Security/Storage.html#Security_Guidance_per_Storage_Solution){target="_blank"} for whichever option you choose
