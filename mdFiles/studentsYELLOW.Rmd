# Student use of yellow data

*Detailed information on use of data by students can be found on the [Security for Students page](https://fgb-rdm.nl/Security/SecurityForStudents.html){target="_blank"}. If you will be supervising students who are given access to research data of any risk level, ensure that you have reviewed the general requirements on this page and that your students have read the [Security Basics page](https://fgb-rdm.nl/Security/SecurityBasics.html){target="_blank"}.*

-   You can provide students access to yellow data via [YODA](https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/yoda.html){target="_blank"}, [Research Drive](https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/researchdrive.html){target="_blank"}, [SciStor](https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/scistor.html){target="_blank"}, Teams/Sharepoint, [SURFdrive](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0012728){target="_blank"}, [ZIVVER](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0012860){target="_blank"} or [SURFFileSender](https://www.surf.nl/en/surffilesender-send-large-files-securely-and-encrypted){target="_blank"}
    -   Review the storage considerations for yellow data on the [Security for Students page](https://fgb-rdm.nl/Security/SecurityForStudents.html#storage){target="_blank"} to ensure that your students can safely and securely work with *only* the data they are allowed to access
